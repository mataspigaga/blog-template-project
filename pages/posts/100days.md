# #100DaysOfCode

_I'll probably arrange this in reverse chronological order after a few more days. Or figure out how to sort it with a button... that'll be fun._

## Day [1/100]

- Time spent: 3 hours
- Main project: Building a very basic cryptocurrency named MatCoin
- **Takeaways:** 
  1. The source code/algorithm is not the same for Bitcoin and Litecoin.
  2. An understanding of the underlying tech is not essential, so I'm now wary of any altcoins I see.
  3. This technology is **really exciting**, I'm quite interested in seeing how this algorithm works under the hood.
- **Challenges:**
  1. Never written anything in C or C++, had to very closely follow the tutorial to avoid syntactic errors.
  2. Still researching the economic implications of mining limits.
  3. Understanding how to start something like this from purely following the breadcrumbs rather than a step-by-step tutorial, but I think that comes with time.
