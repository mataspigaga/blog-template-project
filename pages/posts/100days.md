# #100DaysOfCode

Follow the journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mataspigaga)

_I'll probably arrange this in reverse chronological order after a few more days. Or figure out how to sort it with a button... that'll be fun._

## Day [1/100]

- Time spent: 3 hours
- Main project: Building a very basic cryptocurrency named MatCoin
- **Takeaways:**
  1. The source code/algorithm is not the same for Bitcoin and Litecoin.
  2. An understanding of the underlying tech is not essential, so I'm now wary of any altcoins I see.
  3. This technology is **really exciting**, I'm quite interested in seeing how this algorithm works under the hood.
- **Challenges:**
  1. Never written anything in C or C++, had to very closely follow the tutorial to avoid syntactic errors.
  2. Still researching the economic implications of mining limits.
  3. Understanding how to start something like this from purely following the breadcrumbs rather than a step-by-step tutorial, but I think that comes with time.

## Day [2/100]

- Time spent: 3 hours
- _No main project_
- Spent too much time on figuring out the crypto code until I decided to take a simpler approach. That led me down a road of learning about the various wallets and exchanges, but I'm locked out of deploying the code until the funds clear.
- Spent the rest of the time focusing on sharpening my JS skills, I think that'll really improve my React.js understanding.
- Built a simple drum kit on a static page using JS, using [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)
- **Takeaways:**
  1. It's important to set out a roadplan for the day of learning and/or building. Otherwise, you'll get lost chasing links and ideas.
  2. You can write JS scripts right in the HTML file. In reality, I breazed by JS months ago and went straight to React.js, this is really making things click already.
  3. I need to be using console.log() way more than I have been during practice projects. The course made it clear how he got from just listening to an event to the final result.
- **Challenges:**
  1. Figuring out how to deploy a static site using Vercel. Ideally, I would want to have all of these challenges either part of this site or easily linked.
  2. Trying to understand how the file structure needs to be laid out for deployment.
  3. (Crypto Project): A greater understanding of Solidity and in general blockchain will allow me to feel confident on creating an ERC-20 token.

## Day [3/100]

- Time spent: 1.5 hours
- Main project: Built a simple JS/CSS powered clock
- **Takeaways:**
  1. You can directly interact with CSS from a JS file, updating very quickly.
  2. It's very convenient to modify CSS attributes in the 'inspect element' section of Chrome Dev Tools to figure out a Bezier curve for a transition, for example.
  3. Many beatiful features of a website take **so little code** to implement.
- **Challenges:**

  1. Modifying the existing CSS to make the hours hand smaller. Couldn't figure it out in the time I was working.
  2. How to add these functions within a React component.
  3. Long note:

  - I spent the first part of this session looking into how this blog's underlying code works. I'm not really understanding how Nextra is built based on the provided documentation. Then I looked into what it would take to build this exact site out from scratch, importing MDX functionality myself. I think that'll be an instructive journey.

  ## Day [4/100]

- Time spent: 1 hour
- Main project: Built a test page for CSS variables
- **Takeaways:**
  1. Data attributes. You can create your own attributes so that for example you can add a 'px' suffix to a value being updated.
  2. I'm less timid about updating CSS selectors to make the page fit my needs.
  3. I looked through the addEventListener documentation and saw a simple build of drawing with JS and CSS.
- **Challenges:**
  1. Figuring out how to make the color wheel update realtime like the input sliders.
  2. Not sure if it's possible to make the spacing slider go off screen in all directions rather than extend into the bottom right.
  3. Still not 100% on the uses of the dataset attribute.
